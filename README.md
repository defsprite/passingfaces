sidefacegrabber
===============


Small collection of super-hacky, mercilessly stolen & deranged processing sketches. Consists of two parts: 
- a grabber that takes snapshots of people walking past a webcam, processes them and saves them as images
- a presenter that reads the images and puts them into a "presentation" that can be shown somewhere

For now, you will have to browse through the code and change it according to your needs :-)

Have fun!
